However, different countries present different political histories, and in particular, the development of the breadth of left-right spectrum and the voters’ loyalty to their ideologies over time.\nIn this project, I compare the presidential elections of France-2022 and the USA-2020. I analyze how different the relationship between urban-rural population distribution and left-right voting behavior in France and in the USA.\nI hypothesize that two reasons will effect differences in this relationship: first is the stronger tradition of left-wing politics in France; and the second is the wider spectrum of left-wing ideologies. The longer history of leftism can create a closer political affiliation between the rural population and the left-wing parties. The wider spectrum of political ideologies, on the other hand, can present various opportunities for political parties to establish rapport with the rural populations. This is because in a wider political spectrum, not only the number of parties are higher, but also the substantial issue positions adopted by parties can offer a higher variety in their combinations. In a biparty system, issue positions, such as A, B, C, D, are divided into two, while in a multiparty system the issue positions are not only divided into more sections, but also they are adopted by parties with overlaps such as Party-X can adopt A and B while Party-y can adopt B and D. Since France has a multi-party system, multiple parties can address the interests of the rural voters in different ways, preventing the concentration of vote.\n*sidenote: I was not able to clear the initialization lines of the code below, I will deal with it later.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\n[~ 200 words]\nData\nFrench presidential elections in 2022\nhttps://www.data.gouv.fr/datasets/election-presidentielle-des-10-et-24-avril-2022-resul- tats-definitifs-du-1er-tour/\n\n#download.file(\n # url = \"https://www.data.gouv.fr/api/1/datasets/r/98eb9dab-f328-4dee-ac08-ac17211357a8\",\n  #destfile = \"data/france_election_2022_R1_communes.csv\",\n#  mode = \"wb\"\n#)\n\nFrench urban-rural population (last update 2020)\nhttps://www.insee.fr/fr/information/4802589\n\ndownload.file(\n  url = \"https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/fichier/4802589/UU2020_au_01-01-2025.zip\",\n  destfile = \"data/france_UU2020_commune.zip\",\n  mode = \"wb\"\n)\n\nFrench - Geometric Data for Matching *the file was too large, I will upload it later\nUS presidential elections in 2020*\nhttps:// dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2FVOQCHQ&\nDownload the CSV\ndata_US_elec &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"data/countypres_2000-2024.csv\")\n*I haven’t accomplish setting a download link for this set of data yet.
